From the plotted data, we note that temperature increases as we approach the equator. While this is not surprising, temperatures appear to peak at approximately 20 degrees latitude, which may be due to the tilt in the Earth's axis. Cloudiness and humidity, on the other hand, do not show a strong correlation to latitude. Both visualizations demonstrate a wide of values at similar latitudes. Wind speed, notably, appears to slightly increase as we move away from the equator. Although there is a clear pattern in the plot, this is not a strong correlation and would need to be investigated beyond the scope of the original data in order to establish a definitive conclusion.
